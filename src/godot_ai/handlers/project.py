## Must stay above the plugin's own deferred budget for `run_project`
## (`DEFERRED_TIMEOUT_MS_BY_COMMAND["run_project"] = 6000` in dispatcher.gd).
## `run_project` defers: the plugin returns DEFERRED_RESPONSE and re-polls game
## status until the launch resolves, so it can legitimately take the full 6 s on
## a cold start or a large scene. At the inherited 5.0 s default the server gave
## up first and reported a successful launch as a timeout — which `GodotClient`
## then charged to the editor-bridge circuit breaker.
##
## 6.0 s budget + the repo's standing 2 s transport margin for this exact
## cross-language pairing, spelled out in `handlers/custom.py`: "the server-side
## future must outlive that budget ... +2s margin covers transport latency".
## `vision_routing.gd`'s 13 000 ms editor-screenshot override under
## SCREENSHOT_TIMEOUT_SEC = 15.0 is the same +2. Exact ties exist elsewhere
## (game_eval, game_command, check_client_status) and are not wrong, but the
## plugin's timer starts when the dispatcher registers the deferred request —
## strictly after the server began its own — so the margin costs nothing and
## removes the round-trip from the race.
